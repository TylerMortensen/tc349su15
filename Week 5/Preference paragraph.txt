While completing this assignment I came to realize that working 
on the comp was much easier than working on a style tile.  
I was using a new program called gimp which I have never used before. 
I thought comps were easier because I didn’t have to think from scratch 
on styles because I already had an idea how I wanted the site to look.  
Style tiles are difficult because I need to be very creative and I was 
never great at art.  I spent a lot of time on these and it was difficult 
because I didn’t know the program well so it was hard to get it to look 
just the way I wanted it.  With much time an effort, I believe I got 
it to look clean with straight edges, like the way I wanted it.
